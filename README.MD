# Paper Notes

## A simple 'To Do List' project to pratice my personal Django framework knowledges.

### The Ideia

My initial ideia is to implement a very simple site where a user can register and login, having access to a page where can add post-its with a title and a list of 'checkboxs'. Each one of this checkbox is activity with a description and a deadline to be done.

I what to focus using Django in the back-end, doing just the necessary in the front-end (basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and using PostgreSQL for the database.
